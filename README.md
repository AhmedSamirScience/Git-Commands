# Conventional Commits

## Description
The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

## Commit Message Conventions
We follow a set of commit message conventions to maintain a clear and organized history of changes within the codebase. Below are the prefixes used in commit messages along with their descriptions and examples:

1. **feat**: Indicates a commit introducing a new feature or significant enhancement to the software. <br>
   Example: `feat: Add user authentication functionality`

2. **fix**: Addresses a specific bug or issue within the codebase. <br>
   Example: `fix: Resolve issue with login button not working`

3. **refactor**: Indicates a commit focused on improving code structure, readability, or performance without changing external behavior. <br>
   Example: `refactor: Extract common validation logic into separate class`

4. **docs**: Denotes a commit related to updating or adding documentation, such as code comments, README files, or inline documentation. <br>
   Example: `docs: Update README with installation instructions`

5. **test**: Indicates a commit related to adding, updating, or fixing tests, including unit tests, integration tests, or UI tests. <br>
   Example: `test: Add unit tests for user registration module`

6. **style**: Denotes a commit related to code style changes, such as formatting, indentation, or naming conventions. <br>
   Example: `style: Fix indentation in MainActivity`

7. **chore**: Indicates a commit related to maintenance tasks, project configurations, or other miscellaneous changes that do not fit into other categories. <br>
   Example: `chore: Update dependencies to latest versions`

8. **perf**: Denotes a commit focused on improving application performance, such as optimizing algorithms, reducing resource usage, or enhancing caching mechanisms. <br>
   Example: `perf: Optimize image loading for faster rendering`

9. **config**: Indicates a commit related to project configuration changes, such as build system configurations, environment settings, or CI/CD pipeline configurations. <br>
   Example: `config: Update Gradle build settings for Java 11 compatibility`

10. **release**: Denotes a commit marking the release of a new version of the software, including version number updates, release notes, or tagging commits. <br>
    Example: `release: Version 1.0.0`

## Usage
These prefixes help maintain consistency and provide valuable context about the nature of each commit, making it easier for developers to understand the changes made to the codebase and facilitating collaboration within the development team.
